The given code fragment has 2 while loops which execute the following:

1) The first while loop dequeues the queue and puts them in a stack. As a result the first element in the queue becomes the last element stored in the stack.

2) The second while loop pops out the stack filled in loop 1. Thus, it pops out the values of the queue to queue them back in reverse order.

So, this entire code takes elements from the queue, reverses their order and stores them back in the originally given queue.
